=========

Enables functional, promised-based interactions with Node's [Readable
streams](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable),
inspired by [Legendary](https://github.com/novemberborn/legendary)'s
[`Series`](http://novemberborn.github.io/legendary/lib/series.js.html) class.

## Deprecation Notice
